zope.i18n package changelog
===========================

3.4.0b1
-------

- Fixed dependency on zope.security to require a version that does not have
  the hidden dependency on zope.testing.


Note: Releases between 3.2.0 and 3.4.0b1 were not tracked as individual
packages. The changes can be reconstructed from the Zope 3 changelog.


3.2.0 - 2006/01/05
------------------

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.i18n package shipped as part of the
  Zope 3.2.0 release.

- Added a picklable offset-based timezone to 'pytz', a la
  zope.app.datetimeutils'.  Added tests in 'zope.i18n' to show that we need
  something like it, and then actually use it in 'zope.18n.format'.

- Added support for parsing / formatting timezones using 'pytz' (new external
  dependency).

- Implemented remaining date/time formatters, including adding week
  information to the calendar.


3.0.0 - 2004/11/07
------------------

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.i18n package shipped as part of the
  Zope X3.0.0 release.
